# Architecture

KMP Starter Template follows Clean Architecture principles:

- **Data Layer**: Actual implementations of `domain layer` like Repositories Impl and DataSources
- **Domain Layer**: aka Blurprint layer, contains UseCases (Logics), Repositories and Models
- **Presentation Layer**: Compose UI, States, Actions, Events, ViewModels & Interaction with `domain layer`

!!! info "Logics == UseCases"
    i just don't like the name `usecases` so i renamed it to `logics`, don't get confused when you see `logics` like:

    - `GetConfigLogic`
    - `SignInToPurchasesLogic`

    they are usecases, i just renamed them to `logics`.


## Core Module
There's a module inside `features` called `core` & this contains all 3 layers of `clean architecture`. Whenever you see `core` module in Starter Template it's mean it can be implemented by all it's siblings.

This is very important to understand that `core` feature should only be implemented by it's siblings or sibling's children. like all `features` can implement `core` module

`Core` module contains code that can be shared between modules such as:

- Shared Auth Logic for getting userId
- Onboarding
- Splash
